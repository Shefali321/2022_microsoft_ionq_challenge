# Quantum Chinese Checkers

### Overview- This is a quantum variant of the classic game Chinese Checkers. Opponents try to move their pieces to the spaces on the opposite side of the board. They can move in all six hexagonal directions one space or jump over a neighboring piece.

### Rules
- Goal: Get all of your pieces to the triangle at the opposite side
- Players can choose to break a pieceâ€™s move into a superposition of two other moves specified by direction
- Pieces can move over one space and jumo over other pieces as well.
- When a whole piece tries to jump over a split piece, collapse of the board occurs<br>

### iQuHack 2022- The most challenging part was setting up the idea and We would have liked to created more challenging quantum circuits, but were unsure of how to connect those with the game. <br>
